Integrated environmental monitoring system in C: Retrieve, process, analyze, and report real-time environmental data using a free API. Includes automation, optimization, and real-time alerts. Developed for a computer engineering course. Integrated Environmental Monitoring System This is a C-based integrated environmental monitoring system that interacts with a free API to retrieve real-time environmental data. The system includes functionalities for data retrieval, processing, analysis, and reporting. It also incorporates automation, optimization, and real-time alerts.

Features Data Retrieval: Interact with a free API to retrieve real-time environmental data such as temperature and humidity. Data Processing and Analysis: Process the retrieved data using C programming concepts and implement algorithms to analyze data for anomalies or trends. Data Storage: Store both raw and processed environmental data in files. Reporting System: Generate reports based on the analyzed environmental data. Automation and Integration: Create shell scripts to automate tasks such as data retrieval, processing, and report generation and integrate them with the C program. Optimization and Efficiency: Utilize pointers and dynamic memory allocation to optimize data manipulation and enhance efficiency. Real-time Alerts: Implement real-time alerts using Linux system calls to notify relevant personnel of critical environmental readings. Documentation and Code Organization: Develop comprehensive documentation for the monitoring system and modularize the C code using header files for enhanced code readability. Requirements To run the integrated environmental monitoring system, you need:

C compiler (e.g., GCC) Linux operating system


Use a cron command on your terminal to schedule the script to run at a specific time each day, or simply execute `fetching.sh` on terminal directly if scheduling is not required.
